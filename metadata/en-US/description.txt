AIBuddy Desktop IDE is your intelligent coding partner — a standalone desktop application that brings the power of AI directly to your development workflow.

Built for developers who want AI assistance without leaving their code editor, AIBuddy combines a professional Monaco Editor (the same engine that powers VS Code), an integrated terminal, and cutting-edge AI models to help you write, debug, and understand code faster.

KEY FEATURES:

• AI-Powered Coding — Get intelligent code suggestions, explanations, and refactoring powered by the AIBuddy Vibe Coding API with automatic smart routing for maximum uptime.

• Monaco Editor — Full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting for 100+ languages, IntelliSense, multi-cursor editing, and all the keyboard shortcuts you already know.

• Integrated Terminal — Run commands, build projects, and manage git without switching windows.

• Smart File Management — Open any project folder and let AIBuddy understand your entire codebase structure for context-aware assistance.

• Privacy-First Design — Your code stays on your machine. AI requests go through secure, encrypted channels to our API with no data retention.

• Workspace Boundary Security — AIBuddy strictly operates within your opened project directory. It never accesses files outside your workspace.
